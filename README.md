# C++ implemented Ping CLI application
 This is a C++ implemented Ping CLI application for Linux/ macOS systems, a socket programming project.
 In this project, I use C++ to implement a simple Ping CLI app for macOS and Linux. It can perform normal ping function with more detailed information and allow users to customize the TTL.
 Since I have no previous experience in IT/network programming, it's quite fun to learn some socket knowledge, by the way.  
 I provided a makefile for you, so if you installed makefile, you may use it to produce an executable called ping_cf.  
 And when you use it, please remember to use sudo (root) + ./ ping_cf      +IPv4/ domain name   +  (optional) TTL (1-255). (+ means space)  
 At last, I think applying encapsulation definately makes this short project more readable, and I also added several necessary annotation to save your reading time.  
 Thank you for your time and consideration.
