# Cloudflare_Internship_Naicheng_Wu
 This is my submission of cloudflare internship application: systems.  
 In this project, I use C++ to implement a simple Ping CLI app for macOS and Linux. I fulfilled all the basic requirements and finished extra credit #2 and #3.  
 I'm still trying to finish the extra#1, however, I am very busy this week and have several finals/ papers to prepare and I have to submit that now before all spaces are taken.  
 However, I'll continue on this during this weekend and hope I can figure that out. Since I have no previous experience in IT/network programming, it's quite fun to learn some socket knowledge, by the way.  I provided a makefile for you, so if you installed makefile, you may use it to produce an executable called ping_cf.  
 And when you use it, please remember to use sudo (root) + ./ ping_cf      +IPv4/ domain name   +  (optional) TTL (1-255). (+ means space)  
 At last, I think applying encapsulation definately makes this short project more readable, and I also added several necessary annotation to save your reading time.  
 Thank you for your time and consideration.
